# Restore attachment agent primary

## Trigger

Request restoring the selected recoverable Ready metadata at its current version.

## Outcome

恢复可恢复的 Ready

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- Storage availability differs from metadata availability. Size is one byte through 10 MiB, actual digest/size must match, at most twenty active/pending slots and reserved-byte capacity apply. Pending cancellation is not Ready restoration. Soft deletion does not immediately release budget.
- This operation retains the idempotent-cas contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.

- On agent-skills::authenticated, 恢复仍检查数量; affected saved facts: reads attachment [Deleted at, Deleted by, Version].
