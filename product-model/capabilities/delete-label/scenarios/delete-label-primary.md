# Delete label primary

## Trigger

Confirm soft deletion of the selected definition with its current version.

## Outcome

Label 软删除

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- Associations require a same-Project active definition and at most twenty stored associations; deleted definitions keep associations and their count. Removing an association never deletes its definition.
- This operation retains the cas-delete contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.
