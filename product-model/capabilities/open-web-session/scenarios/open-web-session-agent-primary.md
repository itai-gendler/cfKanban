# Open web session agent primary

## Trigger

Request or present a one-time launch for an explicit target.

## Outcome

安全交付 launch，兑换为来源绑定 Session

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- Launch is one-time for five minutes and rechecks source and target. Browser lifetime is eight hours, absolute cap seven days and renewal interval thirty minutes. Not-due renewal is a no-op; fixed scope is not expanded.
- This operation retains the idempotent contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.

- On agent-skills::authenticated, agent-skills::administration, Owner target/scope 路径; affected saved facts: creates browser launch [Identity, Source credential, Principal, Target, Expires at, Consumed at, Code digest, Revoked at].

- On agent-skills::authenticated, agent-skills::administration, 重新核验来源 Credential; affected saved facts: reads browser launch [Consumed at].

- Invalid submitted code, consumed/revoked/expired offer or invalidated issuing source produces the structured failure. A supplied authenticated identity must still match the operation's current-source and target contract; full recovery retains the original identity and Passkeys, while rotation replaces only its authenticating Credential.

- Non-Owner exchange establishes project_selection and retains the initial entry; Owner retains its target. Revoked source Credential or lost target access returns unavailable. Matching committed replay reports cookie_available=false and redelivers no Session/CSRF secret.
