# Close milestone agent primary

## Trigger

Request closing the selected target with its current version.

## Outcome

Milestone Closed

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- Same-Project Closed targets remain associable; closing does not complete work. Progress excludes deleted tasks and separates Done, Canceled and unfinished.
- This operation retains the cas contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.

- The existing milestone edit is CAS-only; a replay is not an idempotent result lookup and MCP supplies no idempotency key.
