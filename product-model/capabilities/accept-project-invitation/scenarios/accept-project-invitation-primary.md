# Accept project invitation primary

## Trigger

Confirm offered roles and the current or new identity path.

## Outcome

已有或新身份取得目标 grants

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- Preview does not consume. Expired, revoked, consumed or invalidated-source offers fail without a second redemption. Recovery retains stable identity, grants, history and Passkeys. Remote commit can precede pending local promotion.
- This operation retains the idempotent contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.

- Invalid submitted code, consumed/revoked/expired offer or invalidated issuing source produces the structured failure. A supplied authenticated identity must still match the operation's current-source and target contract; full recovery retains the original identity and Passkeys, while rotation replaces only its authenticating Credential.

- A fixed Cookie with any invitation target outside its current scope returns refusal for the entire offer. Mixed new/current fields, authenticated new mode, unauthenticated current mode and current Owner are refused; successful current mode issues no new Credential.
- Current-identity acceptance creates no authentication secret. New-identity acceptance creates the stable identity and its replacement authentication source in that same commit; all offered targets succeed together. Regrant updates the saved revoked source, and an existing writer is not downgraded by a reader offer.
