# Archive workspace primary

## Trigger

Confirm archival of the selected container with its current version; the service records the time and acting identity.

## Outcome

Workspace 归档

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- This operation retains the cas-delete contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.
