# Add relation parent cycle

## Trigger

Submit relation kind and both endpoint identities and versions.

## Outcome

拒绝形成 Parent 环

## Edge cases

- A structured refusal returns no successful write or protected result; it does not undo any earlier confirmed atomic operation.
- Both endpoint versions and visibility are checked separately. Self or cross-Workspace relationships fail. Parent cycles and more than 1,000 checked objects fail without a new relation. Only related normalizes endpoints.
- This operation retains the idempotent contract(s) of its concrete atomic endpoint(s). Stale versions and mismatched replay return structured conflicts; D1/content dependency failure produces no claimed success.
- Traced CLI/Skills/Workbench recovery keeps the original identity, request, version and key. outcome_unknown and committed_unverified remain distinct and neither implies uncommitted or permits a different mutation.
- Either stale endpoint version or the stale link version refuses the entire write; neither endpoint is advanced alone.
